## Project Euler first 100 problems.
I have read somewhere that one is allowed to post the first 100 problems without being banned from the project.

I have recently finished the first 100 problems together with about 50 more problems. This small project is an attempt to revive the solutions, and to make more optimal solutions. Some of the initial algorithms took several days to compute. The project info hints that there should exist a solution that takes about 1 minute on a moderate size computer.
